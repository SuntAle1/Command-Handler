Hello!
You can find me on discord: Sunt Ale#4933
Lets get to work!
Btw i made this on replit so if you are coding on anything else where people cant see your code, such as vs code, etc. you dont need to have |process.env.token| just put your token there and make sure its between |""|!

first of all, if you dont want to use mongo database, go ahead and remove lines 18-28.
if you want to use the mongo database, i suggest you go and watch an youtube video!
also go to the |config.json| file and put your bot prefix there!
so lets begin coding!

1. Dont create a file outside of the |commands| folder that will have |.js| at the end because it will not work!
2. When you create a file in |commands| foler, make sure you put |.js| at the end. for example: help.js, ping.js, etc.
3. You can create other folders in the |commands| folder, so its easier to find the command you are looking for!
4. Yhen you create a file, that has |.js| at the end and its in a folder in the |commands| folder, than go to the |beginning| file and do |ctrl+a|, than |ctrl+c| to copy all that and put it in the file that you created! fill in the |''| in the: |name|, |description| and if you want the |aliases|! than put your code before the first |}| or it will not work!

alright now that we know  how to make the files and where to put them, lets learn a bit about coding!

1. There are packages that you can use, and most of them wil make your work easier! Just search on google: |npm <package>| and replace the |<package>| with the name of the package you want to use!

lets learn about embeds!

1. first lets define the embed: 

const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()

2. now lets see all the options that we can put in the embed!

.setTitle('')
.setDescription('')
.setAuthor('')
.addField('', '')
.setColor('')
.setThumbnail()
.setTimestamp()

after you chose wich of those to put in your embed, it should look something like this:

let embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
.setTitle('This is the embed title!')
.setDescription('This is the embed description!')
.setColor('RANDOM') //make sure its with caps or it wont work!
.setFooter('Hello!')
.setTimesamp()
messge.channel.send(embed)

alright! now if you want to see when someone uses a command, make sure you put after the code, but before the first |}| the following: |console.log('<command name> used!')| and if you want it to show even the person that used the command, do |console.log(`<command name> used by ${message.author.tag}!`)|

this was the mini tutorial!
if you need help, or you find any errors in the code, just dm me on discord!
